# Edmond's Project 4 DEMO 

### ⚠️The "Complete Project" – with full training pipelines is KEPT PRIVATE to prevent unauthorized copying on the PUBLIC INTERNET.

### 🤝 Full access can be HAPPILY shared 'Upon Recruiter Request' to showcase my Full-Stack AI & Computer Vision skills.

### 👉 Try the live demo here: https://edmondproject4-sufseycgcxqbdjysk7c4xv.streamlit.app/

🖼️ Example test car images are available in the [Images_to_test_demo](./Images_to_test_demo) folder.  

** The Streamlit demo may go idle after a period of inactivity — click “Yes, get this app back up” to restart it. Please note that it may take a short while to reload.

📖 Project Overview: 🚗 Car License Plate Detection & Recognition

This project demonstrates how AI can be applied to smart city solutions by detecting car license plates and recognizing the text automatically. It combines object detection (YOLOv8) with OCR (EasyOCR) and is deployed as an interactive web app.

Use cases include: parking systems, toll gates, traffic monitoring, and automated security checks.

🔬 Key Approaches

YOLOv8 Object Detection: Localizes license plates within car images.

OCR with EasyOCR: Reads the alphanumeric characters from cropped plate regions.

End-to-End Pipeline: From image upload → detection → recognition → result display.

Deployment Ready: Integrated into a Streamlit app with Hugging Face–hosted model weights.

📌 Notes for Recruiters

The GitHub repo shows only the demo app code.

The full training pipeline (dataset processing, augmentation, experiments, tuning) is private but can be shared upon request.

This project highlights my ability to integrate object detection + OCR into a deployable AI system.

It is one of several projects I’ve developed to demonstrate end-to-end Full-Stack AI Engineering skills: from model training → deployment → user-facing app.
